# Commutator-free quasi-Magnus operators

This repository contains the code to compute the commutator-free quasi-Magnus cost. The main files can are `magnus_errors.py`, containing the primitives that we need to compute their cost; and `main.py`, where we compute the error per step of each CFQM. The figure generation can be implemented via `time_scaling.py`, `error_scaling.py`, `error_weight.py` and `CFQMs_cost.py`.
